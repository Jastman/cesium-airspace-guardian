        # Important: GitHub Pages usually hosts at https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/
        # We handle this by setting the base path during build if needed, or in vite.config.js
        # But a safer bet without knowing the repo name is ensuring relative paths or simply assuming correct config.
        # Ideally, we pass the repo name as base. 
        # For now, let's rely on vite.config.js update.
